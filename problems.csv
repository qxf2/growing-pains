"How can we make our interviews consistent?","Our interviews are inconsistent. They depend heavily on the interviewer and their background. Further, our notes are not very good. The notes do not help the next interviewer form a good idea of what to expect. They also do not tell me how you were thinking and how you adapted during the interview. This is a problem for all of us since it affects hiring and the kind of colleagues you will get. How can we improve?"
"How to get better at giving peers feedback?","We have a culture of little to no feedback. We don't praise much. We don't condemn much. This was possibly useful in the early days. But as we grow larger, we need to start giving more feedback. How do we give more praise and more criticism?"
"What can you do to improve the team's morale?","All performance rating systems affect intrinsic motivation. Like many of you pointed out, I too expect a dip in the team's motivation levels when QElo goes public. What you can do to improve the morale of your colleagues?"
"How do we delay the instinct to specialize?","As companies grow larger, specialization (and process improvement) start becoming the most suggested solutions to problems. I do not like that approach at all because specialized roles end up becoming silos of information. They prevent our engineers from needing to experience a wide variety of problems. Specialized professionals also end up becoming single points of failure. I would like to avoid specialization until we are at least ~70 people strong. Instead, I would like to tackle the problem by increasing our common understanding and exposure. So what can we do to delay adopting specialization as a solution?"
"How to get better at processing information","I think all of you can handle about 10x the amount of information you are currently handling by developing systems for youselves. This increase in capacity is important. There is simply no way to design rules to tackle the challenges that will come our way when we grow. Instead, most of our coming moves are going to be played based on experience and wisdom. For shared understanding to increase, we need everyone to pay attention to what everyone else is doing. I feel like the amount of information an employee processes is the major reason why most companies fail to bring about a state of shared understanding. So how do we all get better at processing more information?"
"What are some unusual sources that we can hire from?","I'd really like to be hiring from sources that the rest of the industry usually ignores. Doing so is a mutually beneficial move. It gives us a huge leg up in finding talent without having to compete for it. The candidates we find usually feel grateful to get an unusual chance. So how do we identify such people?"
