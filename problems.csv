"How can we make our interviews consistent?","Our interviews are inconsistent. They depend heavily on the interviewer and their background. Further, our notes are not very good. The notes do not help the next interviewer form a good idea of what to expect. They also do not tell me how you were thinking and how you adapted during the interview. This is a problem for all of us since it affects hiring and the kind of colleagues you will get. How can we improve?"
"How to get better at giving peers feedback?","We have a culture of little to no feedback. We don't praise much. We don't condemn much. This was possibly useful in the early days. But as we grow larger, we need to start giving more feedback. How do we give more praise and more criticism?"
"What can you do to improve the team's morale?","All performance rating systems affect intrinsic motivation. Like many of you pointed out, I too expect a dip in the team's motivation levels when QElo goes public. What you can do to improve the morale of your colleagues?"
"How do we delay the instinct to specialize?","As companies grow larger, specialization (and process improvement) start becoming the most suggested solutions to problems. I do not like that approach at all because specialized roles end up becoming silos of information. They prevent our engineers from needing to experience a wide variety of problems. Specialized professionals also end up becoming single points of failure. I would like to avoid specialization until we are at least ~70 people strong. Instead, I would like to tackle the problem by increasing our common understanding and exposure. So what can we do to delay adopting specialization as a solution?"
"How to get better at processing information?","I think all of you can handle about 10x the amount of information you are currently handling by developing systems for youselves. This increase in capacity is important. There is simply no way to design rules to tackle the challenges that will come our way when we grow. Instead, most of our coming moves are going to be played based on experience and wisdom. For shared understanding to increase, we need everyone to pay attention to what everyone else is doing. I feel like the amount of information an employee processes is the major reason why most companies fail to bring about a state of shared understanding. So how do we all get better at processing more information?"
"What are some unusual sources that we can hire from?","I'd really like to be hiring from sources that the rest of the industry usually ignores. Doing so is a mutually beneficial move. It gives us a huge leg up in finding talent without having to compete for it. The candidates we find usually feel grateful to get an unusual chance. So how do we identify such people?"
"Why aren't we talking more to new hires?","We have been through this situation often - most of you have no opinion about a new hire because you have not had a chance to interact with them. In the initial days, that was my fault. But since 2018, I have tried to make the new hire's work visible and open. So what is preventing all of us from paying attention to their work and talking to them?"
"What is a good replacement for sprint based work?","I no longer like sprint based work. We have somehow tranformed it to be super task-based and non-incremental in nature. It's almost like we have a to-do item and we just makes notes about it and drag along the tickets until we finish. The work is definitely not collaborative enough. I'd like us to move to a different way of working. This is going to require us to think about how our work happens and how we collaborate. Normal people like us tried experiments like this in the 90s and by the early 2000s, waterfall had changed to Agile. So it is not all that strange to be playing around with structures likes sprints."
"How do we shorten training and onboarding?","Right now, we spend ~6 months getting a new hire ready. This includes their training and initial R&D tasks.6-months is too long in two ways. One, we can search for clients only after they are almost ready. Two, 6-months of salary for a senior person is quite a lot of investment. It is even more if the senior person quite and we need to pay the next new hire for 6-months. How can we shorten the time to train and onboard?"
"How to interview a diverse set of talents?","As we grow bigger, we are going to come across skilled candidates who do not have any overlap with our skillsets. How can we interview such people fairly? How do we know that they are not bluffing when we do not know their domain/skillset?"
"How can we make the first few weeks at a client easier?","The initial weeks at a challenging client are brutal. While we do mentally prepare new hires and let them know that the work will be challenging, most people do not realize how challenging until they experience client work for themselves. They suddenly feel lost and out of their depth. I feel like we can do something to make new hires realize the kind of presence of mind and speed and technical competence required when we go to a new client. What ideas do you have?"
"Why do we behave differently when on a client?","I have noticed this pattern repeatedly. People show good habits at Qxf2. They also seem to show leadership and initiative when it comes to internal work. They speak up when they think something is not good. However, on clients, I notice most people retreat into a shell. They don't speak up. They don't demand better working conditions. They seem to want to comply to what the client says. This makes me look bad because as part of my sales pitch, I tell clients that our engineers will self-manage and lead. So why are we changing habits that work when we go on a client?"
"How to pay attention to many things?","I bet a few of you feel overwhelmed by the number of things you need to pay attention to - constant buzz on Skype/Slack, client work, Qxf2 work, new hires, interns, interviews, technology, market, etc. I know that at some point, most of you just give up and focus on the top 5 things on your plate. While what I listed may sound overwhelming, as someone who pays attention to all of this, I believe it is possible to develop systems for yourself to get good at this. So, what systems do you think you can develop for yourself?"
"How to multi-task better?","Multi-tasking and context switching is going to be needed in the next phase of our growth. I know that studies tell you that single-tasking is more efficient than multi-tasking. However, single-tasking leads to lesser opportunities over the long run. Every single productive person is multi-tasking. Every single executive (even at super small firms) is multi-tasking. So how can we get better at this essential skill?"
"What habits of Qxf2 can we give up?","We are not forced to continue habits of our past. Even the ones that helped us or the ones that we enjoy. As this company evolves, it is critical that we keep shedding some old habits. Otherwise, in a way, we are restricting the kind of ideas that we produce. What habits can we give up?"
"What is a fair way to handle a firing?","Whether we wish it or not, if we grow, I am going to have to fire people for a variety of reasons ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Firings are always a matter of shock within the company. Not everyone will agree with my decision. I cannot make the decision completely transparent because there is another human's livelihood and professional reputation at stake. Keeping this scenario in mind, what do you think is a fair way of firing people?"
"Where are arbirtrage opportunities in hiring?","It is to our advantage to keep looking for hiring sources that the market undervalues. This makes it beneficial to both the candidate and us. We do not need to compete and the candidate gets an opportunity that might otherwise not be present. An example from our early days - we got Avinash because we reached out to talent in Tier 2 cities. Companies in Bangalore (including us at that time) were not reaching out to outstation candidates. What are similar opportunities that exist today?"
"Where all are we contributing enough?","I have mentioned several times that I do not want to have a pyramid structure. One of the easiest ways to avoid the pyramid structure for a long time is to expose so many opportunities and problems that individual contribution is still possible. And how do we get this long list of problems to solve? In my experience, it is easy to look for areas we are not contributing much and start making a dent. This has the additional advantage of us forming good relationships with people in that area. So, where all do you think we are not contributing enough?"
"How do you ask for a better opportunity?","If we grow, there will be mroe opportunity. And when there is more opportunity, asking for opportunity is going to become important. I have noticed early employees suck at this. What's more, they suffer silently. And when they do speak up, they end up asking for opportunity poorly or ask for the wrong opportunity. I'd really like it if early employees get into the habit of asking for specific opportunities. I will most probably reject your ask (because your ask is going to be out of touch and irrelevant) - but that will help you get better at figuring out what went wrong and how you should improve. So how do we bring about a culture in which all of you speak about the opportunities you want?"
"What do you do when you are stuck in a rut?","Every professional knows this - there are going to be stretches of time (months even!) where you feel you are in a rut. If we are all going to experience it, then we should probably share strategies on what we do when we are stuck in a rut. What tips can you give me?"
